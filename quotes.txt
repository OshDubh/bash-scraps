beautiful things don't ask for attention.
let's just call it a ghost cat, walter mitty.
to see the world; things dangerous to come; to see behind walls; to draw closer; to find each other; and to feel; that is the purpose of life.
it will have the big quintessence of all time.
if i like a moment, i mean me, personally, i don't like to have the distraction of the camera. i just want to... stay... in it. right there. right here.
