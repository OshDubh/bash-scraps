# bash-scraps
A collection of bash scripts to make life easier

## Contents: 
`chx` Modifies the last edited file to be executable [chmod +x].

`gccx` Compiles the last edited c file with gcc.

`lab` Probably unusable unless you have the same file system as me. Looks at the current path and opens the relevant dcu labsheet. Adding any additional command line argument will open that module's einstein latest upload page. My file system: Documents/[module code]/week1.

`mkdircd` Creates a folder and then cd's into it.

`ppx` Runs the last edited python file.

`subl_create` Creates a python/c file and fills it with boilerplate code and a description/author/etc tagline. The first cmdline argument is the name of the file and the optional second is the description you want to give to the file.

`jccx` compiles and executes the last java file edited
